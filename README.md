-How do I approach designing software? What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work?
  
  I design the components needed after decomposing a system to it's common functions. This keeps the code modular and easier to test and debug. For the openGL pipeline, designing each function, such as the function that populated the textures, was a great way to go about this project.


-How do I approach developing programs? What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  
  As with designing the program, I also developed it iteratively. By ensuring one core function worked as intended, I was able to move on to another component to ensure I knew how to implement it's functionality. Once all components were developed, I finalized the project by implementing more code to flesh out the scene with more objects.
  

-How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

  When working in a project with openGL, I learned many core skills when dealing with an external library. I found how the system had it's core components made, and the pipeline process of graphics processing worked with it. I also learned how to traverse documentation, as well as be able to navigate the code better to find out how the program worked. I can use these concepts to be a better programmer as it raises the efficiency at which I understand code that is foreign to me. I understand that graphical computing is a very difficult system to design and implement, so I hope that future libraries I work with can provide further insight on how professional developers create their systems.
